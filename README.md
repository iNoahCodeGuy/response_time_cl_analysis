# 🚗 Lead Response Time Analyzer

A Streamlit application that analyzes the impact of response time on lead close rates. Built with rigorous statistical methods and designed to explain complex concepts to non-technical users.

## 🎯 What This App Does

This application helps you answer a critical sales question:

> **"Does responding faster to leads increase the chance of closing a deal?"**

Upload your lead data, and the app will:

1. **Analyze response time patterns** - See how leads are distributed across response time buckets
2. **Calculate close rates** - Compare conversion rates for fast vs. slow responses
3. **Run statistical tests** - Determine if differences are statistically significant
4. **Control for confounders** - Account for lead source and sales rep effects
5. **Explain everything** - Step-by-step explanations for non-technical users

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iNoahCodeGuy/response_time_cl_analysis.git

Don't have data ready? Click **"Load Sample Data"** to generate 10,000 realistic sample leads and explore the app's features.

## 📊 Data Requirements

Your data should include these columns (names can vary):

| Required Data | Example Column Names |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Lead arrival time | `created_at`, `lead_time`, `timestamp` |
| First response time | `first_response`, `replied_at`, `contacted_at` |
| Lead source | `source`, `channel`, `lead_source` |
| Sales rep | `rep`, `agent`, `salesperson` |
| Order outcome | `ordered`, `sold`, `converted` |

### Supported Formats

- **File types**: CSV, XLSX, XLS
- **Date formats**: ISO, US, European, Excel serial numbers
- **Outcome values**: Boolean, 1/0, Yes/No, text values like "Ordered"

## 🔬 Analysis Features

The application performs comprehensive statistical analysis:

- **Descriptive statistics** - Close rates by response time bucket with confidence intervals
- **Chi-square test** - Tests for overall relationship between response time and conversion
- **Z-test for proportions** - Pairwise bucket comparisons with statistical significance
- **Logistic regression** - Effect size controlling for lead source and other confounders
- **Weekly trends analysis** - Week-over-week pattern analysis to assess consistency
- **Confounding assessment** - Systematic evaluation of potential bias in results
- **Step-by-step explanations** - Plain-English explanations of statistical concepts for non-technical users

## 📈 Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Close Rate** | Percentage of leads that converted to orders |
| **P-Value** | Probability the result is due to chance (< 0.05 = significant) |
| **Odds Ratio** | How much higher/lower the odds of ordering are vs. reference |
| **Confidence Interval** | Range where the true value likely falls |

### Interpreting Significance

- **Significant (p < 0.05)**: Differences unlikely due to random chance
- **Not Significant (p ≥ 0.05)**: Cannot rule out random variation

## ⚠️ Limitations

This analysis has important limitations to keep in mind:

1. **Correlation ≠ Causation** - This is observational data, not a controlled experiment
2. **Unmeasured Confounders** - We can only control for variables we measure
3. **Selection Bias** - Only analyzes leads that received responses
4. **External Validity** - Results may not generalize to different contexts

**For causal conclusions**, note that this observational analysis has limitations in establishing causation. We cannot deliberately delay responses to test the relationship.

## 🛠️ Customization

### Response Time Buckets

Edit `config/settings.py` to change default bucket boundaries:

```python
DEFAULT_BUCKETS = [0, 15, 30, 60, float('inf')]
DEFAULT_BUCKET_LABELS = ['0-15 min', '15-30 min', '30-60 min', '60+ min']
```

### Significance Level

Change the default alpha level in `config/settings.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_ALPHA = 0.05  # Change to 0.01 for stricter threshold
```

## 📚 Statistical Methods

### Chi-Square Test of Independence

Tests whether response time bucket and order outcome are independent:

$$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$$

### Z-Test for Proportions

Compares close rates between two specific buckets:

$$z = \frac{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}}$$

### Logistic Regression

Models log-odds of ordering as a function of response time and controls:

$$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{bucket} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{source}$$
